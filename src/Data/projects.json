Through a structured design process, literature, and expert focus group a research prototype is developed. Using different techniques, including 3D printing, laser cutting, Arduino programming, and hardware evaluation, HarmonizingFlow is developed. During a three-day preliminary study, the prototype is evaluated and future recommendations are made.",

A combination of research through design, user-centered design, and the double diamond technique provided the basis for this design exploration. This project will first describe the origin, previous work, and state of the art on (design) research in the domain of work-life balance. This knowledge is collected by both facilitating expert collaboration and discussion during a focus group session, combined with analyzing validated studies and published literature about the subject. After a clear problem is defined, and existing knowledge is gathered, the project will elaborate on the ideation phase. This step will serve as a further deepening of the understanding of the problem(s), as well as an initial design direction. </br>The ideation phase of this design semester will be directed by validated behavior (change) techniques and human attention frameworks. During this phase, further exploration of the target group and relevant stakeholders will be described through the use of the value flow methodology. The section of the project will conclude by describing the relevant prototyping techniques, facilitating the research artifact. During the final stage of the design process, and thus this project, a final evaluation will be described and performed. Preliminary results, based on direct user feedback gathered through the use of validated research methodology will be presented, followed by a recommendation for further development in the growing domain of work-life balance research and design.

Within this project, I learned to work together with over 15 partners, ranging from municipalities, technology companies, car manufacturers, and European acceleration program ambassadors.

What this effectively means is that city and road planners currently have only one fixed speed available to assign to a certain road. Celeste is a project that changes this. Whenever a road section is considered dangerous due to for example a large number of pedestrians, an active event, bad weather, road works, emergency vehicles, or other road safety influences, a road safety officer is able to reduce the speed on that road section. Alternatively, when the road conditions improve, the speed limit can be increased again. This system will bring increased safety, reduced emissions, higher acceptance, and more to the road users utilizing celeste-fitted roads. At the end of the two-year research project, Celeste concluded with a working back and front-end system, which was tested in three major cities in Europe. The continuation of the project including the commercialization will be continued by a start-up entity.",

However, current technology fails to properly monitor the importance of messages and is lacking in its customizability. Users are generally limited to either being distracted constantly or muting them all together. This paper presents an exploratory study, in which participants focused on solving several puzzles, while both important and non-important notifications came in. Using PaintFocus, participants were actively distracted by important messages, while non-important messages were displayed in a peripheral/ambient display. This paper argues for the importance of filtering notification design which considers how much attention a notification is allowed to grab from a user. To effectively do this, designers have to provide customization and carefully consider how individuals have unique properties when it comes to focusing on a task. This study provides preliminary results that support the need for continued development and research into importance filtered notification displays.",

React operates on the concept of components, which are small, independent, and reusable units of a user interface. Components in React can be written in JavaScript and often utilize .js files. </br> React components can also include styles, which are typically written in CSS. However, developers can use a preprocessor such as Sass to write their styles. Sass extends the functionality of CSS with features such as variables, mixins, and functions. In React, styles written in Sass can be included in the components using .scss files. This enables developers to write more maintainable and modular styles for their React components. </br> By combining the power of JavaScript and Sass, React provides developers with a highly effective toolset for building dynamic and scalable user interfaces. React's components and .js/.scss files make it easy to manage and reuse code, leading to faster and more efficient development.",

In this design report, we present CoasterChat, a tool that embeds digital communication in a daily coffee routine to support social relations between people with early-stage dementia and their family members. CoasterChat is a communication system that aims to asynchronously have both people with dementia and their family members engaged in a sharing moment during their coffee break. Apparent from this preliminary exploration is that technology operable without external support requires personalisation of digital guidance for the person with dementia. This provides an opportunity for technology to be embedded in existing asynchronous routines strengthening structure in the lives of people with dementia. Meanwhile, by integrating multimodal guidance into CoasterChat, we describe how people with dementia are guided seamlessly to use the artifact themselves. The benefit for the family members who engage in the interaction resides in the flexibility and accessibility of sending a message without immediate interaction. Our results reveal opportunities and consideration in design aimed at engaging people with dementia and family members in digital communication embedded in a coffee break routine.",

While many students use activity trackers, the numerical data shown (e.g. steps number) does not provide the stimulation needed to trigger physical activity. By designing a richer and more playful way to experience activity data, we can encourage students to become and remain active. Splash Active is a social service aimed at motivating students to go for a stroll during breaks. Splash uses the sonification of the students’ activity data as a stimulus. The user takes a walk to a Splash waterpoint where he scans the RFID sticker on his bottle. Here he will experience a unique melody based on the user’s activity data and the other Splash users present. By combining intrinsic and social motivation, our concept explores new opportunities within the design space of vitality.",

    "longer_project_desc": "During the first lab sessions I learned how to use lab equipment in combination with breadboards, where the main focus was on voltage and ampere manipulations through different components. This has helped me to understand how circuits can be potentially harmful to components with limited tolerances. Furthermore it has taught me how circuits can be manipulated in order to adhere to these tolerances.</br> During the final mini project I have learned how to convert a creative idea into a clear circuit proposal. I learned how sensors are classified based on their range, operating Voltage/Ampere and error margins. I learned how data conversion computing can be done through the use of code and microcontrollers. Finally I learned how to convert this information to an actuator that is able to display the information gathered by the sensor. Hereby creating a functional prototype. ",
